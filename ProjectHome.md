<p>As Git approaches its fourth anniversary, it is now the revision control system of choice for many of the largest and most successful open source projects, including the Linux kernel and at least twelve other Google Summer of Code 2008 projects: BlueZ, Cairo, DragonFly BSD, Etherboot, One Laptop Per Child, Perl, Samba, Thousand Parsec, The Wine Project, VideoLAN, XMMS2, and X.org.  This achievement is the product of the lively Git development community, a loose-knit team of developers, technical writers, and end users with a passion for high quality open-source development.</p>
